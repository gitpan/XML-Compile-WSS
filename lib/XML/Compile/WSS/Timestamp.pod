=head1 INHERITANCE

 XML::Compile::WSS::Timestamp
   is a XML::Compile::WSS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # used in combination with any XML schema
 my $wss = XML::Compile::WSS::Timestamp->new
   ( ... parametes, some required
   , schema => $anything
   );

 # connects itself to a WSDL
 my $wss  = XML::Compile::SOAP::WSS->new;
 my $wsdl = XML::Compile::WSDL11->new($wsdlfn);
 my $ts   = $wss->timestamp
   ( ... same params, never 'schema'
   );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=item created => DATETIME

By default, for each constructed message the current time is taken.
See L<XML::Compile::WSS::dateTime()|XML::Compile::WSS/"Helpers"> for options on DATETIME.  If you
specify an empty string, then the C<Created> node will be skipped.

=item expires => DATETIME

See L<XML::Compile::WSS::dateTime()|XML::Compile::WSS/"Helpers"> for options on DATETIME.  When
not defined, the C<Expires> node will be skipped.

=item lifetime => SECONDS

When C<lifetime> is given and no C<expires>, then the expiration will
be set to the C<created> time plus this lifetime.  In this case, the
created time cannot be specified as formatted DATE.

=item prepare => 'READER'|'WRITER'|'ALL'|'NONE'

=item schema => an L<XML::Compile::Cache|XML::Compile::Cache> object

=item version => STRING

=item wss_version => '1.1'|MODULE

=item wsu_Id => LABEL

Adds a C<wsu:Id> attribute to the C<wsse:Timestamp>.
