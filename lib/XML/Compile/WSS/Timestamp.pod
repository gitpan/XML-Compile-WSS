=item created => DATE|TIME|''

By default, for each constructed message the current time is taken.
See L<XML::Compile::WSS::dateTime()|XML::Compile::WSS/"Internals"> for options on DATETIME.

=item expires => DATETIME

See L<XML::Compile::WSS::dateTime()|XML::Compile::WSS/"Internals"> for options on DATETIME.

When C<lifetime> is given and no C<expires>, then the expiration will
be set to the C<created> time plus this lifetime.  In this case, the
created time cannot be specified as formatted DATE.

=item schema => L<XML::Compile::Cache|XML::Compile::Cache>

=item version => STRING

=item wss_version => '1.1'|MODULE

=item wsu_Id => LABEL
